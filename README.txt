== Features ==
Polished job board: add a professional-looking job board to your WordPress site. Include it on your Careers page, or add it to your Home page if that works better for your business.

Simple and friendly job seeker experience: My Job Board makes it easy for job seekers to search for jobs by location and company. Each job posting contains a full job description page, including title, description, location, job type and date posted. Candidates can apply now, share the job or send themselves a reminder. 

Keeps your open positions current: When you use the Recruitology recruitment portal to create new job postings, they'll be automatically added to My Job Board on your site. When you fill a position, just “expire” the job in the portal, and it will no longer appear on My Job Board. 

Installing and activating your Recruitology plugin is easy. Click on the installation tab to learn more.
